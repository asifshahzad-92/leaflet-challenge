## UofT Bootcamp Leaflet Challenge

#### Overview

This project creates an *interactive web map* to visualize **earthquake** data from the **United States Geological Survey (USGS)**. It uses *Leaflet.js* to plot earthquake locations, with marker size indicating magnitude and color representing depth. The map also includes tectonic plate boundaries and offers multiple base map options.

#### Data Sources

1. Earthquake data: USGS GeoJSON Feed

2. Tectonic plates: GitHub - fraxen/tectonicplates
